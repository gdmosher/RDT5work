## Maximum Common Substructure (MCS) Searching

The `ChemmineR` add-on package
[`fmcsR`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/fmcsR.html)
provides support for identifying maximum common substructures (MCSs) and
flexible MCSs among compounds. The algorithm can be used for pairwise
compound comparisons, structure similarity searching and clustering. The
manual describing this functionality is available
[here](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/fmcsR/inst/doc/fmcsR.html)
and the associated publication is Wang et al. (2013). The following gives a
short preview of some functionalities provided by the
`fmcsR` package.  


```r
 library(fmcsR)
 data(fmcstest) # Loads test sdfset object 
 test <- fmcs(fmcstest[1], fmcstest[2], au=2, bu=1) # Searches for MCS with mismatches 
 plotMCS(test) # Plots both query compounds with MCS in color 
```

## AP/APset Classes for Storing Atom Pair Descriptors

The function `sdf2ap` computes atom pair descriptors for
one or many compounds (Raymond E. Carhart et al., 1985; X. Chen , 2002). It returns a searchable atom pair database
stored in a container of class `APset`, which can be used
for structural similarity searching and clustering. As similarity
measure, the Tanimoto coefficient or related coefficients can be used.
An `APset` object consists of one or many
`AP` entries each storing the atom pairs of a single
compound. Note: the deprecated `cmp.parse` function is
still available which also generates atom pair descriptor databases, but
directly from an SD file. Since the latter function is less flexible it
may be discontinued in the future.  

Generate atom pair descriptor database for searching: 

```r
 ap <- sdf2ap(sdfset[[1]]) # For single compound
 ap 
```

```
## An instance of "AP"
## <<atom pairs>>
## 52614450304 52615497856 52615514112 52616547456 52616554624 ... length: 528
```


```r
 apset <- sdf2ap(sdfset)
 # For many compounds. 
```
 

```r
view(apset[1:4]) 
```

```
## $`650001`
## An instance of "AP"
## <<atom pairs>>
## 53688190976 53688190977 53688190978 53688190979 53688190980 ... length: 528 
## 
## $`650002`
## An instance of "AP"
## <<atom pairs>>
## 53688190976 53688190977 53688190978 53688190979 53689239552 ... length: 325 
## 
## $`650003`
## An instance of "AP"
## <<atom pairs>>
## 52615496704 53688190976 53688190977 53689239552 53697627136 ... length: 325 
## 
## $`650004`
## An instance of "AP"
## <<atom pairs>>
## 52617593856 52618642432 52619691008 52619691009 52628079616 ... length: 496
```


Return main components of APset objects: 

```r
 cid(apset[1:4]) # Compound IDs 
 ap(apset[1:4]) # Atom pair
 descriptors 
 db.explain(apset[1]) # Return atom pairs in human readable format 
```


Coerce APset to other objects: 

```r
 apset2descdb(apset) # Returns old list-style AP database 
 tmp <- as(apset, "list") # Returns list 
 as(tmp, "APset") # Converts list back to APset 
```


## Large SDF and Atom Pair Databases

When working with large data sets it is often desirable to save the
`SDFset` and `APset` containers as binary
R objects to files for later use. This way they can be loaded very
quickly into a new R session without recreating them every time from
scratch.  

Save and load of `SDFset` and `APset`
containers: 

```r
 save(sdfset, file = "sdfset.rda", compress = TRUE) 
 load("sdfset.rda") save(apset, file = "apset.rda", compress = TRUE)
 load("apset.rda") 
```


## Pairwise Compound Comparisons with Atom Pairs

The `cmp.similarity` function computes the atom pair
similarity between two compounds using the Tanimoto coefficient as
similarity measure. The coefficient is defined as *c/(a+b+c)*, which
is the proportion of the atom pairs shared among two compounds divided
by their union. The variable *c* is the number of atom pairs common in
both compounds, while *a* and *b* are the numbers of their unique
atom pairs. 

```r
 cmp.similarity(apset[1],
 apset[2])
```

```
## [1] 0.2637037
```

```r
 cmp.similarity(apset[1], apset[1]) 
```

```
## [1] 1
```


## Similarity Searching with Atom Pairs

The `cmp.search` function searches an atom pair database
for compounds that are similar to a query compound. The following
example returns a data frame where the rows are sorted by the Tanimoto
similarity score (best to worst). The first column contains the indices
of the matching compounds in the database. The argument cutoff can be a
similarity cutoff, meaning only compounds with a similarity value larger
than this cutoff will be returned; or it can be an integer value
restricting how many compounds will be returned. When supplying a cutoff
of 0, the function will return the similarity values for every compound
in the database. 

```r
 cmp.search(apset,
 apset["650065"], type=3, cutoff = 0.3, quiet=TRUE) 
```

```
##   index    cid    scores
## 1    61 650066 1.0000000
## 2    60 650065 1.0000000
## 3    67 650072 0.3389831
## 4    11 650011 0.3190608
## 5    15 650015 0.3184524
## 6    86 650092 0.3154270
## 7    64 650069 0.3010279
```
Alternatively, the
function can return the matches in form of an index or a named vector if
the `type` argument is set to `1` or
`2`, respectively. 

```r
 cmp.search(apset, apset["650065"], type=1, cutoff = 0.3, quiet=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 61 60 67 11 15 86 64
```

```r
 cmp.search(apset, apset["650065"], type=2, cutoff = 0.3, quiet=TRUE) 
```

```
##    650066    650065    650072    650011    650015    650092    650069 
## 1.0000000 1.0000000 0.3389831 0.3190608 0.3184524 0.3154270 0.3010279
```


## FP/FPset Classes for Storing Fingerprints

The `FPset` class stores fingerprints of small molecules
in a matrix-like representation where every molecule is encoded as a
fingerprint of the same type and length. The `FPset`
container acts as a searchable database that contains the fingerprints
of many molecules. The `FP` container holds only one
fingerprint. Several constructor and coerce methods are provided to
populate `FP/FPset` containers with fingerprints, while
supporting any type and length of fingerprints. For instance, the
function `desc2fp` generates fingerprints from an atom
pair database stored in an `APset`, and
`as(matrix, "FPset")` and `as(character, "FPset")` construct an `FPset` database from
objects where the fingerprints are represented as
`matrix` or `character` objects,
respectively.

## Atom Pair Fingerprints

Atom pairs can be converted into binary atom pair fingerprints of fixed
length. Computations on this compact data structure are more time and
memory efficient than on their relatively complex atom pair
counterparts. The function `desc2fp` generates
fingerprints from descriptor vectors of variable length such as atom
pairs stored in `APset` or `list`
containers. The obtained fingerprints can be used for structure
similarity comparisons, searching and clustering.  

Create atom pair sample data set: 

```r
 data(sdfsample)
 sdfset <- sdfsample[1:10] 
 apset <- sdf2ap(sdfset) 
```


Compute atom pair fingerprint database using internal atom pair
selection containing the 4096 most common atom pairs identified in
DrugBank's compound collection. For details see `?apfp`.
The following example uses from this set the 1024 most frequent atom
pairs: 

```r
 fpset <- desc2fp(apset, descnames=1024, type="FPset") 
```


Alternatively, one can provide any custom atom pair selection. Here, the
1024 most common ones in `apset`: 

```r
 fpset1024 <- names(rev(sort(table(unlist(as(apset, "list")))))[1:1024]) 
 fpset <- desc2fp(apset, descnames=fpset1024, type="FPset") 
```


A more compact way of storing fingerprints is as character values:


```r
 fpchar <- desc2fp(x=apset,
 descnames=1024, type="character") fpchar <- as.character(fpset) 
```


Converting a fingerprint database to a matrix and vice versa:


```r
 fpma <- as.matrix(fpset)
 fpset <- as(fpma, "FPset") 
```


Similarity searching and returning Tanimoto similarity coefficients:


```r
 fpSim(fpset[1], fpset, method="Tanimoto") 
```


Under `method` one can choose from several predefined
similarity measures including *Tanimoto* (default),
*Euclidean*, *Tversky* or
*Dice*. Alternatively, one can pass on custom similarity
functions. 

```r
 fpSim(fpset[1], fpset, method="Tversky", cutoff=0.4, top=4, alpha=0.5, beta=1) 
```


Example for using a custom similarity function: 

```r
 myfct <- function(a, b, c, d) c/(a+b+c+d)
 fpSim(fpset[1], fpset, method=myfct) 
```


Clustering example: 

```r
 simMAap <- sapply(cid(apfpset), function(x) fpSim(x=apfpset[x], apfpset, sorted=FALSE)) 
 hc <- hclust(as.dist(1-simMAap), method="single")
 plot(as.dendrogram(hc), edgePar=list(col=4, lwd=2), horiz=TRUE) 
```


## Fingerprint E-values
The `fpSim` function can also return Z-scores, E-values, and p-values
if given a set of score distribution parameters. These parameters can
be computed over an `fpSet` with the `genParameters` function.



```r
    params <- genParameters(fpset)
```
This function will compute all pairwise distances between the given
fingerprints and then fit a Beta distribution to the resulting
Tanimoto scores, conditioned on the number of set bits in each
fingerprint. For large data sets where you would not want to compute
all pairwise distances, you can set what fraction to sample with the
`sampleFraction` argument. This step only needs to be done once for
each database of `fpSet` objects. Alternatively, if you have a large
database of fingerprints, or you believe that the parameters computed
on a single database are more generally applicable, you can use the
resulting parameters for other databases as well. 

Once you have a set of parameters, you can pass them to `fpSim` with
the `parameters` argument. 


```r
	fpSim(fpset[[1]], fpset, top=10, parameters=params)	
```

```
##    similarity    zscore    evalue    pvalue
## 1   1.0000000 6.2418215  0.000000 0.0000000
## 96  0.4719101 1.6075792  6.748413 0.9988273
## 67  0.4288499 1.2297052 12.012285 0.9999939
## 15  0.4275229 1.2180604 12.211967 0.9999950
## 88  0.4247423 1.1936587 12.638193 0.9999968
## 64  0.4187380 1.1409688 13.594938 0.9999988
## 4   0.4166667 1.1227914 13.936692 0.9999991
## 86  0.3978686 0.9578290 17.319191 1.0000000
## 77  0.3970588 0.9507232 17.476453 1.0000000
## 69  0.3940000 0.9238806 18.079243 1.0000000
```

This will then return a data frame with the similarity, Z-score,
E-value, and p-value. You can change which value will be used as a
cutoff and to sort by by setting the argument `scoreType` to one of
these scores. In this way you could set an E-value cutoff of 0.04 for
example.


```r
	fpSim(fpset[[1]], fpset, cutoff=0.04, scoreType="evalue", parameters=params)	
```

```
##   similarity   zscore evalue pvalue
## 1          1 6.241822      0      0
```


## Pairwise Compound Comparisons with PubChem Fingerprints

The `fpSim` function computes the similarity coefficients
(*e.g.* Tanimoto) for pairwise comparisons of binary fingerprints. For
this data type, *c* is the number of "on-bits" common in both
compounds, and *a* and *b* are the numbers of their unique
"on-bits". Currently, the PubChem fingerprints need to be provided (here
PubChem's SD files) and cannot be computed from scratch in
`ChemmineR`. The PubChem fingerprint specifications can
be loaded with `data(pubchemFPencoding)`.  

Convert base 64 encoded PubChem fingerprints to
`character` vector, `matrix` or
`FPset` object: 

```r
 cid(sdfset) <- sdfid(sdfset)
 fpset <- fp2bit(sdfset, type=1) 
 fpset <- fp2bit(sdfset, type=2) 
 fpset <- fp2bit(sdfset, type=3) 
 fpset 
```

```
## An instance of a 881 bit "FPset" of type "pubchem" with 100 molecules
```


Pairwise compound structure comparisons: 

```r
 fpSim(fpset[1], fpset[2]) 
```

```
##    650002 
## 0.5364807
```


## Similarity Searching with PubChem Fingerprints

Similarly, the `fpSim` function provides search
functionality for PubChem fingerprints: 

```r
 fpSim(fpset["650065"], fpset, method="Tanimoto", cutoff=0.6, top=6) 
```

```
##    650065    650066    650035    650019    650012    650046 
## 1.0000000 0.9944751 0.7435897 0.7432432 0.7230047 0.7142857
```


## Visualize Similarity Search Results

The `cmp.search` function allows to visualize the
chemical structures for the search results. Similar but more flexible
chemical structure rendering functions are `plot` and
`sdf.visualize` described above. By setting the visualize
argument in `cmp.search` to `TRUE`, the
matching compounds and their scores can be visualized with a standard
web browser. Depending on the `visualize.browse`
argument, an URL will be printed or a webpage will be opened showing the
structures of the matching compounds.

View similarity search results in R's graphics device:


```r
 cid(sdfset) <-
 cid(apset) # Assure compound name consistency among objects. 

 plot(sdfset[names(cmp.search(apset, apset["650065"], type=2, cutoff=4, quiet=TRUE))], print=FALSE) 
```

![](../ChemmineR_files/search_result-1.png)


View results online with Chemmine Tools: 

```r
 similarities <- cmp.search(apset, apset[1], type=3, cutoff = 10)
 sdf.visualize(sdfset[similarities[,1]]) 
```
